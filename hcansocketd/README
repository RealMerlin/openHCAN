This is the replacement for hcanhid if you want to use a system with a canbus adapter supported by socketcan.
I built it for use with the MCP2515 can adapter on a raspberry pi. 
I don't know if there is a working kernel module in the actual kernel. If not, you may be able to get one by recompiling the kernel sources

The configuration is done by loading the SPI module because the mcp2515 is connected via SPI
/sbin/modprobe spi_bcm2708
then configure the can interface with the ip command:
/sbin/ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000

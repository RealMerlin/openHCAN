This is the replacement for hcanhid if you want to use a system with a canbus adapter supported by can4linux
I built it for use with the build in can adapter of the bananapi.
As a prerequisite you have to build the can4linux kernel module.
Get the kernel source from lemaker:
Get the sources for can4linux:
svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/can4linux/code/trunk can4linux-code
and compile it with
make TARGET=BANANAPI
